<h2 id="label-Group+D+-+Chris+Wilson+%26+Ashley+Childress">Group D - <em>Chris Wilson &amp; Ashley Childress</em></h2>

<h2 id="label-Application+Overview">Application Overview</h2>

<p>This web application provides a central location for users to store
interesting places or unique locations, called Interest Points. Users may
create a new Interest Point or learn about Interest Points created by
others. The home page initially displays a list of all Interest Points
currently defined in the application and a map that displays each Interest
Point location.</p>

<h1 id="label-Information+for+developers">Information for developers</h1>
<ul><li>
<p>All default information for this application is defined in the db/default
folder. The db/seeds.rb file is used to read all data from the default
files and create database records in this application. Each section in the
db/seeds.rb file defines the structure that should be used in the
corresponding file.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You need <a href="https://github.com/blowmage/minitest-rails">MiniTest -
Rails</a> to run the test suite for this application. All test cases are
written in Spec format. Call <em>&#39;$ rake minitest&#39;</em> before
creating a pull request for this application to ensure all tests pass.</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov">Simplecov</a> is used to
determine coverage of all application code. The coverage report is
automatically generated when the test suite is ran, and is located at
<em>&#39;coverage/index.html&#39;</em> in the top-level application folder.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Documentation for this application is generated using <a
href="http://yardoc.org">Yard</a> and is located at
<em>&#39;doc/index.html&#39;</em> in the top-level application folder.
Simply call <em>&#39;$ yardoc&#39;</em> in the application terminal to
update application documentation.</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dkubb/yardstick">Yardstick</a> is used to
determine whether or not code documentation is adequate and can be
generated by calling *&#39;$ rake yardstick&#39; in the application
terminal. Results are stored in the
<em>&#39;measurements/yard-output.txt&#39;</em> file in the top-level
folder.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Additional application measurements were taken using <a
href="https://github.com/troessner/reek">Reek</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/seattlerb/flog">Flog</a>. Run in the command
terminal using <em>&#39;$ flog &#39;app//</em>.rb&#39;&#39;* or <em>&#39;$
reek .&#39;</em> and results will be automatically stored in the
corresponding text file located in the <em>measurements</em> folder.</p>
</li><li>
<p>All application models and the <em>config/routes.rb</em> file should be
annotated using the <a
href="https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models">Annotate</a> gem. Simply
call <em>&#39;$ annotate&#39;</em> or <em>&#39;$ annotate –routes&#39;</em>
in the command terminal to generate these annotations.</p>

<p>Password reset ability for all users via email and unique password token
<em>(this is not done using the built in features in Devise; instead, this
ability was manually coded in)</em></p>
</li><li>
<p>Dashboards - separate dashboards and controls are available to both
contributors and administrators</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Users can always see the work they need to do, from any page in the
application</p>
</li><li>
<p>This was not built using the active_admin gem (which is not supported in
the version of rails/ruby we are using), so all dashboard functionality was
coded by hand</p>

<p>RBAC access system - the Ability model defines role-based access
permissions for different user roles in the application</p>
</li><li>
<p>Dogecoin donation system - the footer on every page displays a <em>Donate
Dogecoins</em> link. When clicked on, this link uses a javascript alert to
prompt the user to copy our public wallet address in the send portion
of
the user&#39;s desktop wallet program. This same concept could easily be
applied to bitcoin or any other form of cryptocurrency.</p>

<h5 id="label-Functionality+missing+or+not+working"><em>Functionality missing or not working</em></h5>
<ul><li>
<p>Users can not currently get directions to an Interest Point using a
specific address; instead, the application automatically loads the
user&#39;s current location on both desktop and mobile devices;</p>
</li><li>
<p>The ability to <em>report</em> or flag an inappropriate Comment is started,
and is accessible to administrators on the Reports page; however, currently
functionality has not been added in the UI to flag a comment;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Artists are not currently linked to a specific User record; future work
would allow both models to be linked such that any contributor can create a
new Artist and then a new user could claim that person as themselves</p>
<ul><li>
<p>After the artist record is linked, no other users (except admin) could make
changes to their profile</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Roles - the current role set up was not simply hard-coded into the User
model so that future work would allow administrators to define security
rights dynamically in the application</p>
